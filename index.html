        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class="text">
          <b>Counter-Strike (CS)</b> is a series of multiplayer tactical
          first-person shooter video games in which teams of terrorists battle
          to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking,
          assassination) while counter-terrorists try to prevent it (bomb
          defusal, hostage rescue, escort mission). The series began on Windows
          in 1999 with the release of the first game, Counter-Strike. It was
          initially released as a modification ("mod") for Half-Life that was
          designed by Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe before the
          rights to the mod's intellectual property were acquired by Valve, the
          developers of Half-Life, who then turned Counter-Strike into a retail
          product released in 2000.
          <br />
          <br />
          The original Counter-Strike was followed by Counter-Strike: Condition
          Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in March 2004. A
          previous version of Condition Zero that was developed by Ritual
          Entertainment was released alongside it as Condition Zero: Deleted
          Scenes. Eight months later, Valve released Counter-Strike: Source, a
          remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to
          run on Valve's then-newly created Source engine. The fourth game in
          the main series, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released by
          Valve in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden
          Path Entertainment, who worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release,
          helped to develop the game alongside Valve. Counter-Strike 2 was
          announced in March 2023 and publicly released on September 27, 2023,
          as a replacement for Global Offensive.

          There have been several third-party spin-off titles created for Asian
          markets over the years. These include the Counter-Strike Online
          series, Counter-Strike Neo, and Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio.

          <h1>Gameplay</h1>
          <div class="text">
            Counter-Strike is an objective-based, multiplayer tactical
            first-person shooter. Two opposing teams—the Terrorists and the
            Counter Terrorists—compete in game modes to complete objectives,
            such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing
            or guarding hostages.At the end of each round, players are rewarded
            based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend
            on more powerful weapons in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds
            results in more money than losing and completing objectives such as
            killing enemy players gives cash bonuses.Uncooperative actions, such
            as killing teammates, result in a penalty.
