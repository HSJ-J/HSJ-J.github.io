              Originally a modification for Half-Life, the development team was
              hired by Valve in 2000, when the company acquired the rights to
              Counter-Strike. The game received a port to Xbox in 2003.It was
              also ported to OS X and Linux in the form of a beta in January
              2013. A full release was published in April 2013.

              Counter-Strike was followed up with Counter-Strike: Condition
              Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. It
              used the Half-Life GoldSrc engine, similarly to its predecessor.
              Besides the multiplayer mode, it also included a single-player
              mode with a "full" campaign and bonus levels. The game received
              mixed reviews in contrast to its predecessor and was quickly
              followed with a further entry to the series titled Counter-Strike:
              Source.

              Program on August 11, 2004.On August 18, 2004, the beta was
              released to owners of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and to those
              who had bought ATI Radeon video cards bundled with a Half-Life 2
              voucher.While the original release only included a version for
              Microsoft Windows, the game eventually received a port to OS X on
