        <h1>Counter-Strike Major Championships</h1>
        <div class="text">
          <b>Counter-Strike Major Championships</b> commonly known as the
          Majors, are Counter-Strike (CS) esports tournaments sponsored by
          Valve, the game's developer. The first Valve-recognized Major took
          place in 2013 in Jönköping, Sweden and was hosted by DreamHack with a
          total prize pool of US$250,000 split among 16 teams. This, along with
          the following 18 Majors, was played in Counter-Strike: Global
          Offensive. As of the 2023 release of Counter-Strike 2 (CS2),
          Counter-Strike esports, including the Majors, are played in CS2.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since then, the Major circuit has expanded significantly, with recent
          tournaments advertising a US$2,000,000 prize pool and featuring
          twenty-four teams from around the world. The Majors are considered to
          be the most important and prestigious tournaments in the
          Counter-Strike scene.
          <br />
          <br />
          The current champions are Natus Vincere, who won their second Major at
          PGL Major Copenhagen 2024, the first to be held in Counter-Strike 2.
          Astralis hold the record for the most Major titles with four.

          <h1>History</h1>
          <div class="text">
            <b>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</b> is a multiplayer
            first-person shooter video game developed by Hidden Path
            Entertainment and Valve. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike
            series. The first game in the series, Counter-Strike 1.6, was
            officially released in 2000 and competitive play began soon after.
            The first significant international tournament was the 2001
            Cyberathlete Professional League Winter Championship, considered the
            first "Major". The CPL Summer and Winter Championships, along with
            the World Cyber Games, Electronic Sports World Cup and Intel Extreme
            Masters World Championships, were considered Majors by the
            community, although Valve did not sponsor or give any official
            designation to the tournaments.
            <br />
            <br />
            Swedish teams, most notably SK Gaming, dominated early Majors but
            the Polish roster known as the Golden Five were the most successful
            lineup. Many teams from other parts of the world would win Majors,
            including Team 3D from the United States at CPL Winter 2002 and WCG
            2004, NoA from Norway at CPL Winter 2004, mibr from Brazil at ESWC
            2006, and WeMade FOX from South Korea at WEM 2010.
            <br />
            <br />
            On September 16, 2013, a year after the release of Global Offensive,
            Valve announced a US$250,000 community-funded prize pool for the
            first official CS:GO Major. The money was partially community-funded
            through the game's Arms Deal update, which allowed players to buy
            in-game skins. Valve announced the tournament would take place in
            Sweden and would be hosted by DreamHack. The tournament took place
            in late November and was won by the Swedish team Fnatic who upset
            Ninjas in Pyjamas in the finals. After Dreamhack 2013, Valve
            announced they would partner with tournament organizers to host
            three Majors per year. These Majors are the most prestigious events
            in the competitive CS:GO scene, and the professional players'
            legacies are often judged by their performances at these
            tournaments.
            <br />
            <br />
            The early Majors were dominated by Swedish teams, as Fnatic and NiP
            combined to win the four of the first six Majors. NiP would play in
            five of the first six grand finals. When Fnatic won Cologne 2015,
            they became the first team to win back to back Majors, and the first
            to win a third Major in total. Only the Danish team Astralis has
            since matched that total.
            <br />
            <br />
            At the end of 2015, Valve announced that MLG would host the first
            Major in North America. On February 23, 2016, with MLG Columbus 2016
            coming up, Valve announced a permanent increase in the prize pool
            from US$250,000 to US$1,000,000. However, Valve reduced the number
            of Majors per year from three to two. Luminosity Gaming, a Brazilian
            team, won the event to becomes the first non-European team to win a
            Major. This roster would also go on to win back to back Majors, with
            their second as SK Gaming at ESL One Cologne 2016.
            <br />
            <br />
            Gambit Esports, made up primarily of players from Kazakhstan, won
            PGL Major Kraków 2017 to become the first Asian and CIS team to win
            a Major.
            <br />
            <br />
            On December 13, 2017, the general manager of ELEAGUE, the hosts of
            the ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018, announced a revised format designed
            by Valve and ELEAGUE that would expand the number of teams in the
            Major from sixteen to twenty-four. This was also the first Major to
            take place in multiple cities, as the group stages took place in
            Atlanta at the Turner Studios. Cloud9, an American team, won the
            event to become the first North American team to win a Major.
            <br />
            <br />
            After Boston 2018, the Danish team Astralis became the top team in
            CS:GO and one of the best teams in Counter-Strike history. With wins
            at London 2018, Katowice 2019, and Berlin 2019, Astralis become the
            first team to win three Majors in a row and four majors total. After
            Berlin 2019, Valve and ESL announced the following Major, ESL One
            Rio 2020, which was to be the first Major to be hosted in South
            America. Rio 2020, originally scheduled for May, was then postponed
            to November due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The November Major was
            announced with a US$2,000,000 prize pool, combining the amounts that
            would have been set aside for both Majors. In September 2020, the
            Rio Major was officially canceled due to COVID-19. In December 2020,
            Valve moved the 2021 Major from May to October and November, citing
            concerns over the pandemic. On January 14, 2021, Valve announced
            that the championship would be held between October 23 and November
            7 in Stockholm. Over two years after the last Major, PGL Major
            Stockholm 2021 took place, with favourites Natus Vincere dominating
            the tournament and becoming the first team in CS:GO history to win a
            Major without dropping a single map throughout the tournament. PGL
            Major Stockholm 2021 surpassed the long-standing Counter-Strike
            viewership record 4 times; reaching 2.75 million concurrent viewers
            in the final.
            <br />
            <br />
            FaZe Clan won the PGL Major Antwerp 2022, defeating Natus Vincere
            2-0, and becoming the first international team in CS:GO history to
            win a Major.
            <br />
            <br />
            The previously cancelled ESL One Rio 2020 Major was replaced with
            IEM Rio Major 2022 and was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on October
            31 - November 13, 2022. Outsiders, a neutral name for esports
            organization Virtus.pro due to ties with the Russian government in
            light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, won the tournament
            defeating Heroic in the grand final 2-0.

            with a prize pool of $1,250,000 USD. Shortly after the announcement
            of Counter-Strike 2, the official CS:GO twitter account announced
            that the BLAST Paris Major would be the last CS:GO Major with the
            next major happening in March 2024 in CS2. Team Vitality, a French
            organization with native star player Mathieu 'ZywOo' Herbaut,
            defeated dark horse GamerLegion by 2-0 to clinch the final CS:GO
            Major title.

            Arena. On November 12, 2023, Perfect World, who are responsible for
            distributing Counter-Strike 2 in China, announced the second major
            following the release of Counter-Strike 2, taking place in Shanghai
